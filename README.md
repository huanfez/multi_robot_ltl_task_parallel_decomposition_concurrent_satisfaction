# Packages for paper "Parallel decomposition and concurrent satisfaction for heterogeneous multi-robot task and motion planning under temporal logic specifications"

DEDS experiment, which does not run real robots

Ubuntu18.0 
ROS Melodic 
Python2
JAVA 8.0+

Lab computer location: Titan

***
This is a large project. 
It contains the task planning (automaton-based) with JAVA; and motion planning (Turtlebot3) with ROS.

Each folder contains its own read me files. Please explore into each foler for the `readme.md` files.


## Package1. task_planning_pkg (ouput task plan in a string format)

## Package2. ros_pkgs (refer to the results from Package1 and conduct motion simulation in Gazebo)

## results. comparison results in a table

## turtlebot3, turtlebot3_msgs, turtlebot3_simulations are the preliminary packages from the official repository of turtbot3 website https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/quick-start/
